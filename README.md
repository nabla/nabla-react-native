#  Nabla React Native SDK

The [Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/) React Native SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent healthcare communication experience in your React Native app. We provide powerful and customizable UI elements that can be used out-of-the-box to create a full healthcare communication experience. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

Right now the library is in alpha, meaning all core features are here and ready to be used but API might change during the journey to a stable 1.0 version.

## ⚠️ End of support

We took the decision to discontinue the Nabla Care Platform and with that stop maintaining the Nabla RN SDK.

The Nabla Care Platform will remain operational until September 30th, 2024, but we would greatly appreciate it if you could transition before that date. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition and are here to assist you in any way you need. You can fork this SDK repository if you want to modify it or reuse it with a different backend.

## Documentation

Check our [documentation portal](https://docs.nabla.com/docs/concepts-rn) for in depth documentation about integrating the SDK.

## Getting started

The Nabla Messaging UI SDK is compatible:
- On Android with Android 8 (API Level 23) and higher.
- On iOS with iOS 13 and higher.

Install the SDK by running:

```sh
yarn add @nabla/react-native-messaging-ui @nabla/react-native-messaging-core @nabla/react-native-core
```
or
```sh
npm install --save @nabla/react-native-messaging-ui @nabla/react-native-messaging-core @nabla/react-native-core 
```

And then run `pod install` in your `ios` directory, in order to install the native dependencies.

You can find the latest version available in the [release page](https://github.com/nabla/nabla-react-native/releases).

## Sample app

You can find an example of a basic integration of the Messaging UI SDK in our [demo app](https://github.com/nabla/nabla-react-native/tree/main/messaging-sample-app).
